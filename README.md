NetworkingLibrary
=================

This networking library that I developed provides a very simple API for utilization of TCP and UDP effectively and efficiently. It is built ontop of a networking wrapper I developed which handles all server and client communication over TCP and UDP.


This networking library runs on Desktop and on Android.

## Starting A Server

When you want to start a new server you need to extend the abstract class "NEServerManager" which will handles all threads and prep the server for incoming clients.
